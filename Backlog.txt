4. make them match the OCSF Schema for "Security finding": https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000006587
5. for each saved search, go back and transform them into  
    a. STAR rule (chained from saved search)
    b. SDL Alerts
    c. PQ monitor if needed
6. Write a general approach for how to analyze a new data set being onboarded
    what are all the basic grouping / stats functions to run to find outliers and unusual behavior
7. copy query examples from old github page
8. create sample queries (not alerts, actual sample queries to show people how to do them from a to b
    lookup query 
    look at multiple time horizons like this one: https://sentinelone.slack.com/archives/C01RYRX7XL1/p1715797717167209
