comparing to use case from splunk: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SCS/current/Search/Stringtemplates

//first lets create some fake data to work on
//specifies a max of ten rows
| limit 10 
//in each row, create 4 columns with these values
| let ip1='1.1.1.1', ip2='2.2.2.2', ip3='3.3.3.3', ip4='4.4.4.4'
// create a new field Description which will append a few fields with some text
//and then count the number of entries that fit this grouping. which should be 10, because we have 10 identical rows
| group count() by Description = "IPs in this log include " + ip1 + ", " +ip2 +  ", " +ip3 +  ", " +ip4, ip1, ip2


or if you want to do some math on it

//first lets create some fake data to work on
//specifies a max of ten rows
| limit 10 
//in each row, create 4 columns with these values
| let firstNumber= 5, secondNumber= 10, thirdNumber = -40, fourthNumber = 25

//now lets evaluate the lowest and highest values by creating an array of all our numbers and finding the largest and smallest
| let numberArray = array(firstNumber, secondNumber, thirdNumber, fourthNumber)
| let highest = array_max(numberArray)
| let lowest = array_min(numberArray)

//and finally, lets find the difference between them
| let difference = "Diff between " + lowest + " and " + highest + " is " + abs(highest - lowest)
