Step 1: Ingest your TI

option 1 - ingest them as logs using the SentinelOne Collector, HEC, etc. For example, here is a document for how to ingest Threat Intelligence from Recorded Future: https://app.scalyr.com/solutions/import-recordedfuture



Step 2:

make sure you  have a parser that will parse the threat intel. in our example you are doing so with a parser named 'intel' and generating fields md5, sha1, and sha256

Step 3: 

perform a join query on the actual data and these threat intel logs in order to generate a result

here is an example:

|join 
intel = (parser contains 'intel' | group count() by md5 = data.indicator_data.file.md5, sha1 = data.indicator_data.file.sha1, sha256 = data.indicator_data.file.sha256),
live = (tgt.file.md5= * | group count() by md5 = tgt.file.md5, sha1 = tgt.file.sha1, sha256 = tgt.file.sha256 )

on md5, sha1, sha256

now turn it into an alert

option A: use an SDL alert and simply copy the query in

option B: create a PQ monitor using this query to create a new table / log source with something like logfile="TI_Evals"

and then create a STAR rule querying for logfile-"TI_Evals"
