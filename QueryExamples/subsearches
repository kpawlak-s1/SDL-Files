In splunk it is possible to perform subsearches: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.1/Search/Aboutsubsearches

where you pass the results of a query as a parameter to a second query by nesting the first query inside the second as a subsearch. 
In the SPL example provided, the subsearch is generating a 1x1 table of the top IP address in field "clientip"


                | join


                a=
                (
                dataSource.name =* src_endpoint.ip=*
                | columns dataSource.name, src_endpoint.ip
                ),

                b=(
                src_endpoint.ip contains "."
                | group EventCount=count() by src_endpoint.ip
                | sort -EventCount 
                | limit  1
                | let IsTopTalker= "True"
                | columns src_endpoint.ip, IsTopTalker
                )

                on src_endpoint.ip

                | filter IsTopTalker != "True"
