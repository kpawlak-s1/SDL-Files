1. Make sure all S1 products are enrolled to send 100% of data to Singularity Data Lake (if applicable) where they do not do so by default
    a. Cloud Native Security: https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000010159
    b. Identity: go to Configuration > System > SentinelOne XDR (see the image named "S1 Identity to XDR.png" in this same folder) and enter your xdr hostname (usually xdr.us1.sentinelone.net or similar)   and your SDL API key
    c. Console logs??? think this is automatic now (may 2024)
